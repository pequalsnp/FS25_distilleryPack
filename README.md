# Farming Simulator 25 Distillery Pack Mod

* This mod is a work in progress

# New Placeables

* Distillery - Creates spirits from various inputs
* Rickhouse - Ages sprits in barrels to increase profitability

# New Fill Types

* Malted Barley
* Moonshine - low quality liquor, quick to produce from sugar
* Whisky - spirit produced from fermenting malted barley and distilling it
* Rum - spirit produced from fermenting sugarcane (TODO: molasses production?)
* Aged Whisky
* Dark Rum

# New Production Chains

TODO: Economics are completely random at this point, needs balancing
